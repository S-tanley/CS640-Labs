## Iperfer
The `Iperfer` directory contains the implementation of the `Iperfer` 
program in Java, along with a Makefile for compilation. 
The `Iperfer.java` file includes the code for both the client and server 
functionalities of the `Iperfer` program, which is designed to measure 
network performance metrics such as latency and throughput. 
The Makefile provides commands to compile the Java code and run the 
client and server components of the `Iperfer` program.

## Measurement
The `measurement` directory contains the results of various network 
performance measurements, including latency and throughput data for 
different scenarios (L1, L2, L3, L4). Each scenario has its own text 
file (e.g., `latency_L1.txt`, `throughput_L1.txt`, etc.) that contains
the recorded measurements. The naming follows the required format mentioned 
in the assignment instructions. For the measurements of Q3, the files 
are named like xxx_Q3_xxx.text.

Additionally, there is an `answers.txt` file that includes predictions 
for questions Q2-Q4 based on the measurements, as well as an experimental 
analysis of the results. This file provides insights into the observed 
network performance metrics and discusses any trends or anomalies found 
in the data.
